					<p>From this number must be excepted Canning.

					<p>[The phrase, “great moral lesson,” was employed by the Duke of Wellington, à propos of the restoration of pictures and statues to their “rightful owners,” in a despatch addressed to Castlereagh, under date, Paris, September 19, 1815 (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Dispatches, <abbr>etc.</abbr></i> (<abbr>ed.</abbr> by Colonel Gurwood), 1847, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span> 270).

He adds, for Southey’s consolation and encouragement, that “for several years the verses have been selling in the streets as a broadside,” and that “it would serve no purpose to exclude them on the present occasion.” But Southey was not appeased. He tells Allan Cunningham (June 3, 1833) that “the new edition of Byron’s works is⁠ ⁠… one of the very worst symptoms of these bad times” (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Life and Correspondence</i>, 1850, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span> 217).] <a href="dedication.xhtml#noteref-10" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

Obedience to nature is the only virtue.” It is possible that Byron traced his own lineaments in this too life-like portraiture, and at the same time conceived the possibility of a new Don Juan, “made up” after his own likeness. His extreme resentment at Coleridge’s just, though unwise and uncalled-for, attack on Maturin stands in need of some explanation.

During one of these, he read and translated the lines alluding to Buonaparte, in the Third Canto of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Childe Harold</i>. He informed me, that he was authorized by the illustrious personage⁠—(still recognized as such by the Legitimacy in Europe)⁠—to whom they were read, to say, <em>that ‘the delineation was complete,’</em> or words to this effect. It is no puerile vanity which induces me to publish this fact;⁠—but <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Hazlitt accuses my inconsistency, and infers my inaccuracy. Perhaps he will admit that, with regard to the latter, one of the most intimate family connections of the Emperor may be equally capable of deciding on the subject. I tell <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Hazlitt that I never flattered Napoleon on the throne, nor maligned him since his fall. I wrote what I think are the incredible antitheses of his character.</p>
					<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Hazlitt accuses me further of delineating <em>myself</em> in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Childe Harold</i>, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr> I have denied this long ago⁠—but, even were it true, Locke tells us, that all his knowledge of human understanding was derived from studying his own mind. From <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Hazlitt’s opinion of my poetry I do not appeal; but I request that gentleman not to insult me by imputing the basest of crimes⁠—<abbr>viz.</abbr> ‘praising publicly the same man whom I wished to depreciate in his adversity:’⁠—the <em>first</em> lines I ever wrote on Buonaparte were in his dispraise, in 1814⁠—the <em>last</em>, though not at all in his favour, were more impartial and discriminative, in 1818.

A disappointed man with a bad temper, he is endowed with considerable but not first-rate abilities, and has blundered on through life, remarkable only for a fluency, in which he has many rivals at the bar and in the Senate, and an eloquence in which he has several Superiors. ‘Willing to wound and <em>not</em> afraid to strike, until he receives a blow in return, he has not yet betrayed any illegal ardour, or Irish alacrity, in accepting the defiances, and resenting the disgraceful terms which his proneness to evil-speaking have (sic) brought upon him. In the cases of Mackinnon and Manners,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1217" id="noteref-1217" epub:type="noteref">1217</a> he sheltered himself behind those parliamentary privileges, which Fox, Pitt, Canning, Castlereagh, Tierney, Adam, Shelburne, Grattan, Corry, Curran, and Clare disdained to adopt as their buckler. The House of Commons became the Asylum of his Slander, as the Churches of Rome were once the Sanctuary of Assassins.</p>
						<p>“His literary reputation (with the exception of one work of his early career) rests upon some anonymous articles imputed to him in a celebrated periodical work; but even these are surpassed by the Essays of others in the same Journal. He has tried every thing and succeeded in nothing; and he may perhaps finish as a Lawyer without practice, as he has already been occasionally an orator without an audience, if not soon cut short in his career.</p>
						<p>“The above character is <em>not</em> written impartially, but by one who has had occasion to know some of the baser parts of it, and regards him accordingly with shuddering abhorrence, and just so much fear as he deserves. In him is to be dreaded the crawling of the centipede, not the spring of the tiger⁠—the venom of the reptile, not the strength of the animal⁠—the rancour of the miscreant, not the courage of the Man.</p>
						<p>“In case the prose or verse of the above should be actionable, I put my name, that the man may rather proceed against me than the publisher⁠—not without some faint hope that the brand with which I blast him may induce him, however reluctantly, to a manlier revenge.”</p>

						<p class="continued">but I do not mean them for present publication, because I will not, at this distance, publish <em>that</em> of a Man, for which he has a claim upon another too remote to give him redress.</p>
						<p>“With regard to the Miscreant Brougham, however, it was only long after the fact, and I was made acquainted with the language he had held of me on my leaving England (with regard to the Dss of <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">D.</abbr>’s house),<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1218" id="noteref-1218" epub:type="noteref">1218</a> and his letter to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Me.</abbr> de Staël, and various matters for all of which the first time he and I foregather⁠—be it in England, be it on earth⁠—he shall account, and one of the two be carried home.</p>
						<p>“As I have no wish to have mysteries, I merely prohibit the <em>publication</em> of these stanzas in <em>print</em>, for the reasons of fairness mentioned; but I by no means wish <em>him not</em> to <em>know</em> their existence or their tenor, nor my intentions as to himself: he has shown no forbearance, and he shall find none. You may show them to <em>him</em> and to all whom it may concern, with the explanation that the only reason that I have not had satisfaction of this man has been, that I have never had an opportunity since I was aware of the facts, which my friends had carefully concealed from me; and it was only by slow degrees, and by piecemeal, that I got at them. I have not sought him, nor gone out of my way for him; but I will <em>find</em> him, and then we can have it out: he has shown so little courage, that he <em>must</em> fight at last in his absolute necessity to escape utter degradation.</p>
						<p>“I send you the stanzas, which (except the last) have been written nearly two years, merely because I have been lately copying out most of the <abbr>MSS.</abbr> which were in my drawers.”</p>

					<p>[Here, and elsewhere in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Don Juan</i>, Byron attacked Coleridge fiercely and venomously, because he believed that his protégé had accepted patronage and money, and, notwithstanding, had retailed scandalous statements to the detriment and dishonour of his advocate and benefactor (see letter to Murray, November 24, 1818, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Letters</i>, 1900, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> 272; and “Introduction to the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Vision of Judgment</i>,” <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Poetical Works</i>, 1901, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> 475). Byron does not substantiate his charge of ingratitude, and there is nothing to show whether Coleridge ever knew why a once friendly countenance was changed towards him. He might have asked, with the Courtenays, <i xml:lang="la">Ubi lapsus, quid feci?</i> If Byron had been on his mind or his conscience he would have drawn up an elaborate explanation or apology; but nothing of the kind is extant.

					<p>[“Almost all <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Don Juan</i> is <em>real</em> life, either my own, or from people I knew. By the way, much of the description of the <em>furniture</em>, in Canto Third, is taken from <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Tully’s Tripoli</i> (pray <em>note this</em>), and the rest from my own observation. Remember, I never meant to conceal this at all, and have only not stated it, because <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Don Juan</i> had no preface, nor name to it.” <cite>—⁠Letter to Murray, August 23, 1821, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Letters</i>, 1901, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span> 346.</cite></p>
					<p>The first edition of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Tully’s Tripoli</i> is entitled <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Narrative of a Ten Years’ Residence in Tripoli In Africa: From the original correspondence in the possession of the Family of the late Richard Tully, <abbr>Esq.</abbr>, the British Consul</i>, 1816, 410. The book is in the form of letters (so says the Preface) written by the Consul’s sister. The description of Haidée’s <em>dress</em> is taken from the account of a visit to Lilla Kebbiera, the wife of the Bashaw (<abbr>p.</abbr> 30); the description of the furniture and refreshments from the account of a visit to “Lilla Amnani,” Hadgi Abderrahmam’s Greek wife (<abbr>pp.</abbr> 132⁠–⁠137). It is evident that the “Chiel” who took <em>these</em> “notes” was the Consul’s <em>sister</em>, not the Consul: “Lilla Aisha, the Bey’s wife, is thought to be very sensible, though rather haughty. Her apartments were grand, and herself superbly habited. Her chemise was covered with gold embroidery at the neck; over it she wore a gold and silver tissue <em>jileck</em>, or jacket without sleeves, and over that another of purple velvet richly laced with gold, with coral and pearl buttons set quite close together down the front; it had short sleeves finished with a gold band not far below the shoulder, and discovered a wide loose chemise of transparent gauze, with gold, silver, and ribband strips. She wore round her ancles⁠ ⁠… a sort of fetter made of a thick bar of gold so fine that they bound it round the leg with one hand; it is an inch and a half wide, and as much in thickness: each of these weighs four pounds. Just above this a band three inches wide of gold thread finished the ends of a pair of trousers made of pale yellow and white silk.”</p>
					<p>Page 132. “[Lilla] rose to take coffee, which was served in very small china cups, placed in silver filigree cups; and gold filigree cups were put under those presented to the married ladies. They had introduced cloves, cinnamon, and saffron into the coffee, which was abundantly sweetened; but this mixture was very soon changed, and replaced by excellent simple coffee for the European ladies.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
					<p>Page 133. “The Greek then shewed us the gala furniture of her own room.⁠ ⁠… The hangings of the room were of tapestry, made in pannels of different coloured velvets, thickly inlaid with flowers of silk damask; a yellow border, of about a foot in depth, finished the tapestry at top and bottom, the upper border being embroidered with Moorish sentences from the Koran in lilac letters. The carpet was of crimson satin, with a deep border of pale blue quilted; this is laid over Indian mats and other carpets. In the best part of the room the sofa is placed, which occupies three sides in an alcove, the floor of which is raised. The sofa and the cushions that lay around were of crimson velvet, the centre cushions were embroidered with a sun in gold of highly embossed work, the rest were of gold and silver tissue. The curtains of the alcove were made to match those before the bed. A number of looking-glasses, and a profusion of fine china and chrystal completed the ornaments and furniture of the room, in which were neither tables nor chairs. A small table, about six inches high, is brought in when refreshments are served; it is of ebony, inlaid with mother-of-pearl, tortoiseshell, ivory, gold and silver, of choice woods, or of plain mahogany, according to the circumstances of the proprietor.”</p>
					<p>Page 136. “On the tables were placed all sorts of refreshments, and thirty or forty dishes of meat and poultry, dressed different ways; there were no knives nor forks, and only a few spoons of gold, silver, ivory, or coral.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
					<p>Page 137. “The beverage was various sherbets, some composed of the juice of boiled raisins, very sweet; some of the juice of pomegranates squeezed through the rind; and others of the pure juice of oranges. These sherbets were copiously supplied in high glass ewers, placed in great numbers on the ground.⁠ ⁠… After the dishes of meat were removed, a dessert of Arabian fruits, confectionaries, and sweetmeats was served; among the latter was the date-bread. This sweetmeat is made in perfection only by the blacks at Fezzan, of the ripe date of the country.⁠ ⁠… They make it in the shape of loaves, weighing from twenty to thirty pounds; the stones of the fruit are taken out, and the dates simply pressed together with great weights; thus preserved, it keeps perfectly good for a year.”] <a href="canto-3.xhtml#noteref-287" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>[“He writes like a man who has that clear perception of the truth of things which is the result of the guilty knowledge of good and evil; and who, by the light of that knowledge, has deliberately preferred the evil with a proud malignity of purpose, which would seem to leave little for the last consummating change to accomplish. When he calculates that the reader is on the verge of pitying him, he takes care to throw him back the defiance of laughter, as if to let him know that all the Poet’s pathos is but the sentimentalism of the drunkard between his cups, or the relenting softness of the courtesan, who the next moment resumes the bad boldness of her degraded character.

					<p>[Coleridge was married to Sarah Fricker, October 5; Southey to her younger sister Edith, November 15, 1795. Their father, Stephen Fricker, who had been an innkeeper, and afterwards a potter at Bristol, migrated to Bath about the year 1780. For the last six years of his life he was owner and manager of a coal wharf. He had inherited a small fortune, and his wife brought him money, but he died bankrupt, and left his family destitute. His widow returned to Bristol, and kept a school. In a letter to Murray, dated September 11, 1822 (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Letters</i>, 1901, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span> 113), Byron quotes the authority of “Luttrell,” and “his friend <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Nugent,” for the statement that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Southey and “Coleridge’s Sara⁠ ⁠… before they were married⁠ ⁠… were milliner’s or dressmaker’s apprentices.” The story rests upon their evidence.

					<p>This is a fact. A few years ago a man engaged a company for some foreign theatre, embarked them at an Italian port, and carrying them to Algiers, sold them all.

He contrived to get them on board a vessel, which took them to Janina, where he sold them for the basest purposes. Some died from the effect of the climate, and some from suffering. Among the few who returned were a Signor Molinari, and a female dancer named Bonfiglia, who afterwards became the wife of Crespi, the tenor singer.

Still more lamentable is his error who can believe that there is anything of divine infallibility in this clamour of that small though loud portion of the community ever governed by factitious influence, which under the name of the <strong>Public</strong>, passes itself upon the unthinking for the <strong>People</strong>.” Naturally enough Byron regarded this pronouncement as a taunt if not as a challenge. Wordsworth’s noble appeal from a provincial to an imperial authority, from the present to the future, is not strengthened by the obvious reference to the popularity of contemporaries.] <a href="canto-4.xhtml#noteref-419" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The assassination alluded to took place on the 8th of December, 1820, in the streets of Ravenna, not a hundred paces from the residence of the writer. The circumstances were as described.</p>

The commandant of the troops is <em>now</em> lying <em>dead</em> in my house. He was shot at a little past eight o’clock, about two hundred paces from my door. I was putting on my great coat to visit Madame la Comtessa <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr>, when I heard the shot. On coming into the hall, I found all my servants on the balcony, exclaiming that a man was murdered. I immediately ran down, calling on Tita (the bravest of them) to follow me. The rest wanted to hinder us from going, as it is the custom for everybody here, it seems, to run away from ‘the stricken deer.’⁠ ⁠… we found him lying on his back, almost, if not quite, dead, with five wounds; one in the heart, two in the stomach, one in the finger, and the other in the arm. Some soldiers cocked their guns, and wanted to hinder me from passing. However, we passed, and I found Diego, the adjutant, crying over him like a child⁠—a surgeon, who said nothing of his profession⁠—a priest, sobbing a frightened prayer⁠—and the commandant, all this time, on his back, on the hard, cold pavement, without light or assistance, or anything around him but confusion and dismay. As nobody could, or would, do anything but howl and pray, and as no one would stir a finger to move him, for fear of consequences, I lost my patience⁠—made my servant and a couple of the mob take up the body⁠—sent off two soldiers to the guard⁠—despatched Diego to the Cardinal with the news, and had him carried upstairs into my own quarters. But it was too late⁠—he was gone.⁠ ⁠… I had him partly stripped⁠—made the surgeon examine him, and examined him myself. He had been shot by cut balls or slugs. I felt one of the slugs, which had gone through him, all but the skin.⁠ ⁠… He only said, ‘O Dio!’ and ‘Gesu!’ two or three times, and appeared to have suffered little. Poor fellow! he was a brave officer; but had made himself much disliked by the people.”⁠—Letter to Moore, December 9, 1820, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Letters</i>, 1901, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span> 133.

					<p>It may not be unworthy of remark, that Bacon, in his essay on “Empire” (Essays, <abbr>No.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XX</span>), hints that Solyman was the last of his line; on what authority, I know not. These are his words: “The destruction of Mustapha was so fatal to Solyman’s line; as the succession of the Turks from Solyman until this day is suspected to be untrue, and of strange blood; for that Selymus the second was thought to be supposititious.” But Bacon, in his historical authorities, is often inaccurate.

His consequence always depended on a woman, and he was always unfaithful to her. Nothing could equal the activity of his mind, nor the indolence of his body. No dangers could appal his courage; no difficulties force him to abandon his projects. But the success of an enterprise always brought on disgust.⁠ ⁠… Everything with him was desultory; business, pleasure, temper, carriage. His presence was a restraint on every company. He was morose to all that stood in awe of him, and caressed all such as accosted him with familiarity.⁠ ⁠… None had read less than he; few people were better informed.⁠ ⁠… One while he formed the project of becoming Duke of Courland; at another he thought of bestowing on himself the crown of Poland. He frequently gave intimations of an intention to make himself a bishop, or even a simple monk. He built a superb palace, and wanted to sell it before it was finished. In his youth he had pleased her [Catherine] by the ardour of his passion, by his valour, and by his masculine beauty.⁠ ⁠… Become the rival of Orloff, he performed for his sovereign whatever the most romantic passion could inspire. He put out his eye, to free it from a blemish which diminished his beauty. Banished by his rival, he ran to meet death in battle, and returned with glory.”] <a href="canto-7.xhtml#noteref-617" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>[For a detailed account of Suvóroff’s personal characteristics, see <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Life of Field-Marshal Souvaroff</i>, by <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">L. M. P.</abbr> Tranchant de Laverne, 1814, <abbr>pp.</abbr> 267⁠–⁠291; and <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Suvóroff</i>, by <abbr>Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Spalding, 1890, <abbr>pp.</abbr> 222⁠–⁠229.</p>
					<p>Byron’s epithet “buffoon” (line 5) may, perhaps, be traced to the following anecdote recorded by Tranchant de Laverne (<abbr>p.</abbr> 281): “During the first war of Poland⁠ ⁠… he published, in the order of the day, that at the first crowing of the cock the troops would march to attack the enemy, and caused the spy to send word that the Russians would be upon them some time after midnight. But about eight o’clock Souvarof ran through the camp, imitating the crowing of a cock.⁠ ⁠… The enemy, completely surprised, lost a great number of men.”</p>
					<p>For his “praying” (line 6), vide <abbr>ibid.</abbr>, <abbr>pp.</abbr> 272, 273: “He made a short prayer after each meal, and again when going to bed. He usually performed his devotions before an image of <abbr>St.</abbr> Nicholas, the patron saint of Russia.”</p>
					<p>“Half-dirt” (line 5) is, however, a calumny (<abbr>ibid.</abbr> <abbr>p.</abbr> 272): “It was his custom to rise at the earliest dawn; several buckets of cold water were thrown over his naked body.”</p>
					<p>The same writer (<abbr>p.</abbr> 268) repudiates the charges of excessive barbarity and cruelty brought against Suvóroff by <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">C. F. P.</abbr> Masson, in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="fr">Mémoires Secrets sur la Russie</i> (vide, <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">e.g.</abbr>, <abbr>ed.</abbr> 1800, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 311): “<i xml:lang="fr">Souvorow ne scroit que le plus ridicule bouffon, s’il n’étoit pas montré le plus barbare guerrier. C’est un monstre, qui renferme dans le corps d’un singe l’âme d’un chien de boucher. Attila, son compatriote, et don’t il descend, peut-être ne fut ni si heureux, ni si féroce.</i>”</p>
					<p>Suvóroff did not regard himself as “half-demon.” “Your pencil,” he reminded the artist Müller, “will delineate the features of my face. These are visible: but my inner man is hidden. I must tell you that I have shed rivers of blood. I tremble, but I love my neighbour. In my whole life I have made no one unhappy; not an insect hath perished by my hand. I was little; I was big. In fortune’s ebb and flow, relying on God, I stood immovable⁠—even as now.” (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Suvóroff</i>, 1890, <abbr>p.</abbr> 228, note.)] <a href="canto-7.xhtml#noteref-636" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>[Daniel Boone (1735⁠–⁠1820) was the grandson of an English settler, George Boone, of Exeter. His great work in life was the conquest of Kentucky. Following in the steps of another pioneer, John Finley, he left his home in North Carolina in May, 1769, and, after numerous adventures, effected a settlement on the Kentucky river. He constructed a fort, which he named Boonesborough, and carried on a protracted campaign with varying but final success against the Indians. When Kentucky was admitted into the Union, February 4, 1791, he failed to make good his title to his property at Boonesborough, and withdrew to Mount Pleasant, beyond the Ohio. Thence, in 1795, he removed to Missouri, then a Spanish possession. Napoleon wrested Missouri from the Spaniards, only to sell the territory to the United States, with the result that in 1810 he was confirmed in the possession of 850 out of the 8000 acres which he had acquired in 1795. “Boone was then seventy-five years of age, hale and strong.

Just at the close of day the gentle gales retired, and left the place to the disposal of a profound calm. Not a breeze shook the most tremulous leaf.

					<p>[The story of the attempted assassination (February 11, 1818) of the Duke of Wellington, which is dismissed by Alison in a few words (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book"><abbr>Hist.</abbr> of Europe</i> (1815⁠–⁠1852), 1853, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 577, 578), occupies many pages of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Supplementary Despatches</i> (1865, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XII</span> 271⁠–⁠546). Byron probably drew his own conclusions as to the Kinnaird-Marinet incident, from the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Letter to the Duke of Wellington on the Arrest of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">M.</abbr> Marinet</i>, by Lord Kinnaird, 1818. The story, which is full of interest, may be briefly recounted. On January 30, 1818, Lord Kinnaird informed Sir George Murray (Chief of the Staff of the Army of Occupation) that a person, whose name he withheld, had revealed to him the existence of a plot to assassinate the Duke of Wellington. At 12:30 <abbr>a.m.</abbr>, February 11, 1818, the Duke, on returning to his Hotel, was fired at by an unknown person; and then, but not till then, he wrote to urge Lord Clancarty to advise the Prince Regent to take steps to persuade or force Kinnaird to disclose the name of his informant. A <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G. W.</abbr> Chad, of the Consular Service, was empowered to proceed to Brussels, and to seek an interview with Kinnaird. He carried with him, among other documents, a letter from the Duke to Lord Clancarty, dated February 12, 1818. A postscript contained this intimation: “It may be proper to mention to you that the French Government are disposed to go every length in the way of negotiation with the person mentioned by Lord Kinnaird, or others, to discover the plot.”</p>
					<p>Kinnaird absolutely declined to give up the name of his informant, but, acting on the strength of the postscript, which had been read but not shown to him, started for Paris with “the great unknown.” Some days after their arrival, and while Kinnaird was a guest of the Duke, the man was arrested, and discovered to be one Nicholle or Marinet, who had been appointed <i xml:lang="fr">receveur</i> under the restored government of Louis <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XVIII</span>, but during the <i xml:lang="fr">Cent jours</i> had fled to Belgium, retaining the funds he had amassed during his term of office. Kinnaird regarded this action of the French Government as a breach of faith, and in a “Memorial” to the French Chamber of Peers, and his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Letter</i>, maintained that the Duke’s postscript implied a promise of a safe conduct for Marinet to and from Paris to Brussels. The Duke, on the other hand, was equally positive (see his letter to Lord Liverpool, May 30, 1818) “that he never intended to have any negotiations with anybody.” Kinnaird was a “dog with a bad name.” He had been accused (see his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Letter to the Earl of Liverpool</i>, 1816, <abbr>p.</abbr> 16) of “the promulgation of dangerous opinions,” and of intimacy “with persons suspected.” The Duke speaks of him as “the friend of Revolutionists”! It is evident that he held the dangerous doctrine that a promise to a rogue <em>is</em> a promise, and that the authorities took a different view of the ethics of the situation. It is clear, too, that the Duke’s postscript was ambiguous, but that it did not warrant the assumption that if Marinet went to Paris he should be protected. The air was full of plots. The great Duke despised and was inclined to ignore the pistol or the dagger of the assassin; but he believed that “mischief was afoot,” and that “great personages” might or might not be responsible. He was beset by difficulties at every turn, and would have been more than mortal if he had put too favourable a construction on the scruples, or condoned the imprudence of a “friend of Revolutionists.”] <a href="canto-9.xhtml#noteref-733" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

He was consulted by Lady Byron, in 1816, with regard to her husband’s supposed derangement, but was not admitted when he called at the house in Piccadilly.

					<p>[“Ernest John Biren was born in Courland [in 1690]. His grandfather had been head groom to James, the third Duke of Courland, and obtained from his master the present of a small estate in land.⁠ ⁠… In 1714 he made his appearance at <abbr>St.</abbr> Petersburg, and solicited the place of page to the Princess Charlotte, wife of the Tzarovitch Alexey; but being contemptuously rejected as a person of mean extraction, retired to Mittau, where he chanced to ingratiate himself with Count Bestuchef, Master of the Household to Anne, widow of Frederic William, Duke of Courland, who resided at Mittau. Being of a handsome figure and polite address, he soon gained the good will of the duchess, and became her secretary and chief favourite. On her being declared sovereign of Russia, Anne called Biren to Petersburg, and the secretary soon became Duke of Courland, and first minister or rather despot of Russia. On the death of Anne, which happened in 1740, Biren, being declared regent, continued daily increasing his vexations and cruelties, till he was arrested, on the 18th of December, only twenty days after he had been appointed to the regency; and at the revolution that ensued he was exiled to the frozen shores of the Oby.” <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Catherine <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span></i>, by <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Tooke, 1800, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 160, <em>footnote</em>. He was recalled in 1763, and died in 1772.</p>
					<p>In a letter to his sister, dated June 18, 1814, Byron gives a slightly different version of the incident, recorded in his note (<i xml:lang="la">vide supra</i>): “The Duchess of Somerset also, to mend matters, insisted on presenting me to a Princess <em>Biron</em>, Duchess of Hohen-God-knows-what, and another person to her two sisters, Birons too. But I flew off, and <em>would</em> not, saying I had had enough of introductions for that night at least.”⁠—<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Letters</i>, 1899, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span> 98. The “daughters of Courland” must have been descendants of “Pierre, dernier Duc de Courlande, De la Maison de Biron,” <abbr>viz.</abbr> Jeanne Cathérine, born June 24, 1783, who married, in 1801, François Pignatelli de Belmonte, Duc d’Acerenza, and Dorothée, born August 21, 1793, who married, in 1809, Edmond de Talleyrand Périgord, Duc de Talleyrand, nephew to the Bishop of Autun.

					<p>If there be any gemman so ignorant as to require a traduction, I refer him to my old friend and corporeal pastor and master, John Jackson, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Esq.</abbr>, Professor of Pugilism; who, I trust, still retains the strength and symmetry of his model of a form, together with his good humour, and athletic as well as mental accomplishments.</p>
					<p>[Gentleman Jackson was of good renown. “Servility,” says Egan (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Life in London</i>, 1823, <abbr>p.</abbr> 217), “is not known to him. Flattery he detests. Integrity, impartiality, good-nature, and manliness, are the corner-stones of his understanding.” Byron once said of him that “his manners were infinitely superior to those of the Fellows of the College whom I meet at the high table” (<abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J. W.</abbr> Clark, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Cambridge</i>, 1890, <abbr>p.</abbr> 140).

As to the stanza quoted by Egan (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Anecdotes of the Turf</i>, 1827, <abbr>p.</abbr> 44), but not <em>traduced</em> or interpreted, “To be hobbled for making a clout” is to be taken into custody for stealing a handkerchief, to “turn snitch” is to inform, and the “forty” is the £40 offered for the detection of a capital crime, and shared by the police or Bow Street runners. Dangerous characters were let alone and tacitly encouraged to continue their career of crime, until the measure of their iniquity was full, and they “weighed forty.” If Jack was clumsy enough to be detected in a trifling theft, his “blowen” would go over to the enemy, and betray him for the sake of the Government reward (see <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue</i>, by Francis Grose, 1823, <abbr>art.</abbr> “Weigh forty”).] <a href="canto-11.xhtml#noteref-869" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>[According to Charles Greville, George the Third made two wills⁠—the first in 1770, the second, which he never signed, in 1810. By the first will he left “all he had to the Queen for her life, Buckingham House to the Duke of Clarence,” <abbr>etc.</abbr>, and as Buckingham House had been twice sold, and the other legatees were dead, a question arose between the King and the Duke of York as to the right of inheritance of their father’s personal property. George <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> conceived that it devolved upon him personally, and not on the Crown, and “consequently appropriated to himself the whole of the money and the jewels.” It is possible that this difference between the brothers was noised abroad, and that old stories of the destruction of royal wills were revived to the new king’s discredit.

					<p>[Byron’s description of the place of his inheritance, which was to know him no more, is sketched from memory, but it unites the charm of a picture with the accuracy of a ground-plan. Eight years had gone by since he had looked his last on “venerable arch” and “lucid lake” (see “Epistle to Augusta,” stanza <span epub:type="z3998:roman">viii</span> lines 7, 8), but he had not forgotten, he could not forget, that enchanted and enchanting scene.</p>
					<p>Newstead Abbey or Priory was founded by Henry <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>., by way of deodand or expiation for the murder of Thomas Becket. Lands which bordered the valley of the Leen, and which had formed part of Sherwood Forest, were assigned for the use and endowment of a chapter of “black canons regular of the order of <abbr>St.</abbr> Augustine,” and on a site, by the river-side to the south of the forest uplands (stanza <span epub:type="z3998:roman">lv</span> lines 5⁠–⁠8) the new stede, or place, or station, arose. It was a “Norman Abbey” (stanza <span epub:type="z3998:roman">lv</span> line 1) which the Black Canons dedicated to Our Lady, and, here and there, in the cloisters, traces of Norman architecture remain, but the enlargement and completion of the monastery was carried out in successive stages and “transition periods,” in a style or styles which, perhaps, more by hap than by cunning, Byron rightly named “mixed Gothic” (stanza <span epub:type="z3998:roman">lv</span> line 4). To work their mills, and perhaps to drain the marshy valley, the monks dammed the Leen and excavated a chain of lakes⁠—the largest to the north-west, Byron’s “lucid lake;” a second to the south of the Abbey; and a third, now surrounded with woods, and overlooked by the “wicked lord’s” “ragged rock” below the Abbey, half a mile to the south-east. The “cascade,” which flows over and through a stone-work sluice, and forms a rocky water-fall, issues from the upper lake, and is in full view of the west front of the Abbey. Almost at right angles to these lakes are three ponds: the Forest Pond to the north of the stone wall, which divides the garden from the forest; the square “Eagle” Pond in the Monks’ Garden; and the narrow stew-pond, bordered on either side with overhanging yews, which drains into the second or Garden Lake. Byron does not enlarge on this double chain of lakes and ponds, and, perhaps for the sake of pictorial unity, converts the second (if a second then existed) and third lakes into a river.</p>
					<p>The Abbey, which, at the dissolution of monasteries in 1539, was handed over by Henry <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span> to Sir John Byron, “steward and warden of the forest of Shirewood,” was converted, here and there, more or less, into a baronial “mansion” (stanza lxvi.). It is, roughly speaking, a square block of buildings, flanking the sides of a grassy quadrangle. Surrounding the quadrangle are two-storied cloisters, and in the centre a “Gothic fountain” (stanza <span epub:type="z3998:roman">lxv</span> line 1) of composite workmanship. The upper portion of the stonework is hexagonal, and is ornamented with a double row of gargoyles (all “monsters” and no “saints,” recalling, perhaps identical with, the “seven deadly sins” gargoyles, still <i>in situ</i> in the quadrangle of Magdalen College, Oxford); the lower half, which belongs to the seventeenth or eighteenth century, is hollowed into niches of a Roman or classical design. (In Byron’s time the fountain stood in a courtyard in front of the Abbey, but before he composed this canto it had been restored by Colonel Wildman to its original place within the quadrangle. Byron was acquainted with the change, and writes accordingly.) When the Byrons took possession of the Abbey the upper stories of the cloisters were converted, on three sides of the quadrangle, into galleries, and on the fourth, the north side, into a library. Abutting on the cloisters are the monastic buildings proper, in part transformed, but with “much of the monastic” preserved. On the west, the front of the Abbey, the ground floor consists of the entrance hall and Monks’ Parlour, and, above, the Guests’ Refectory or Banqueting-hall, and the Prior’s Parlour. On the south, the Xenodochium or Guesten Hall, and, above, the Monks’ Refectory, or Grand Drawing-room; on the south and east, on the ground floor, the Prior’s Lodgings, the Chapter House (“the exquisite small chapel,” stanza <span epub:type="z3998:roman">lxvi</span> line 5), the “slype” or passage between church and Chapter House; and in the upper story, the state bedrooms, named after the kings, Edward <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span>., Henry <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VII</span>., <abbr>etc.</abbr>, who, by the terms of the grant of land to the Prior and Canons, were entitled to free quarters in the Abbey. During Byron’s brief tenure of Newstead, and for long years before, these “huge halls, long galleries, and spacious chambers” (stanza <span epub:type="z3998:roman">lxxvii</span> line 1) were half dismantled, and in a more or less ruinous condition. A few pictures remained on the walls of the Great Drawing-room, of the Prior’s Parlour, and in the apartments of the south-east wing or annexe, which dates from the seventeenth century (see the account of a visit to Newstead in 1812, in <i>Beauties of England and Wales</i>, 1813, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">xii</span>. 401⁠–⁠405). There are and were portraits, by Lely (stanza <span epub:type="z3998:roman">lxviii</span> line 7), of a Lady Byron, of Fanny Jennings, Duchess of Tyrconnel, “loveliness personified,” of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Hughes, and of Nell Gwynne; by Sir Godfrey Kneller, of William and Mary; by unnamed artists, of George <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> and George <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>.; and by Ramsay, of George <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span>. There are portraits of a fat Prior, William Sandall, with a jewelled reliquary; of “Sir John the Little with the Great Beard,” who ruled in the Prior’s stead; and there is the portrait, a votive tablet of penitence and remorse, “of that Lord Arundel Who struck in heat the child he loved so well” (see “A Picture at Newstead,” by Matthew Arnold, <i>Poetical Works</i>, 1890, <abbr>p.</abbr> 177); but of portraits of judges or bishops, or of pictures by old masters, there is neither trace nor record.</p>
					<p>But the characteristic feature of Newstead Abbey, so familiar that description seems unnecessary, and, yet, never quite accurately described, is the west front of the Priory Church, which is in line with the west front of the Abbey. “Half apart,” the southern portion of this front, which abuts on the windows of the Prior’s Parlour, and the room above, where Byron slept, flanks and conceals the west end of the north cloisters and library; but, with this exception, it is a screen, and nothing more. In the centre is the “mighty window” (stanza <span epub:type="z3998:roman">lxii</span> line 1), shorn of glass and tracery; above are six lancet windows (which Byron seems to have regarded as niches), and, above again, in a “higher niche” (stanza <span epub:type="z3998:roman">lxi</span> line 1), is the crowned Virgin with the Babe in her arms, which escaped, as by a miracle, the “fiery darts”⁠—the shot and cannon-balls of the Cromwellian troopers. On either side of the central window are “two blank windows containing tracery [‘geometrical decorated’]⁠ ⁠… carved [in relief] on the solid ashlar;” on either side of the window, and at the northern and southern extremities of the front, are buttresses with canopied niches, in each of which a saint or apostle must once have stood. Over the west door there is the mutilated figure of (?) the Saviour, but of twelve saints or twelve niches there is no trace. The “grand arch” is an ivy-clad screen, and nothing more. Behind and beyond, in place of vanished nave, of aisle and transept, is the smooth green turf; and at the east end, on the site of the high altar, stands the urn-crowned masonry of Boatswain’s tomb.</p>
					<p>Newstead Abbey was sold by Lord Byron to his old schoolfellow, Colonel Thomas Wildman, in November, 1817. The house and property were resold in 1861, by his widow, to William Frederick Webb, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Esq.</abbr>, a traveller in many lands, the friend and host of David Livingstone. At his death the estate was inherited by his daughter, Miss Geraldine Webb, who was married to General Sir Herbert Charles Chermside, G.C.M.G., <abbr>etc.</abbr>, Governor of Queensland, in 1899.</p>

It is possible that this stanza was written after the Canto as a whole was finished. But, if not, an incident which took place in the House of Commons, April 17, 1823, during a debate on Catholic Emancipation, may be quoted in corroboration of Brougham’s unreadiness with regard to the point of honour. In the course of his speech he accused Canning of “monstrous truckling for the purpose of obtaining office,” and Canning, without waiting for Brougham to finish, gave him the lie: “I rise to say that that is false” (<i>Parl.

					<p>It would have taught him humanity at least. This sentimental savage, whom it is a mode to quote (amongst the novelists) to show their sympathy for innocent sports and old songs, teaches how to sew up frogs, and break their legs by way of experiment, in addition to the art of angling⁠—the cruelest, the coldest, and the stupidest of pretended sports. They may talk about the beauties of nature, but the angler merely thinks of his dish of fish; he has no leisure to take his eyes from off the streams, and a single <i>bite</i> is worth to him more than all the scenery around. Besides, some fish bite best on a rainy day. The whale, the shark, and the tunny fishery have somewhat of noble and perilous in them; even net fishing, trawling, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, are more humane and useful. But angling!⁠—no angler can be a good man.</p>

					<p>[Byron loved to make fact and fancy walk together, but, here, his memory played him false, or his art kept him true. The Black Friar walked and walks in the Guests’ Refectory (or Banqueting Hall, or “Gallery” of this stanza), which adjoins the Prior’s Parlour, but the room where Byron slept (in a four-post bed⁠—a coronet, at each corner, atop) is on the floor above the Prior’s Parlour, and can only be approached by a spiral staircase. Both rooms look west, and command a view of the “lake’s billow” and the “cascade.” Moreover, the Guests’ Refectory was never hung with “old pictures.” It would seem that Don Juan (perhaps Byron on an emergency) slept in the Prior’s Parlour, and that in the visionary Newstead the pictures forsook the Grand Drawing-Room for the Hall. Hence the scene! <i>El Libertado</i> steps out of the Gothic Chamber “forth” into the “gallery,” and lo! “a monk in cowl and beads.” But, <i>Quien sabe?</i> The Psalmist’s caution with regard to princes is not inapplicable to poets.] <a href="canto-16.xhtml#noteref-1168" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

The ghosts, however, and the Gothics, and the waters, and the desolation, make it very lively still.” “It was,” comments Moore (<i>Life</i>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 262, note 1), “if I mistake not, during his recent visit to Newstead, that he himself actually fancied he saw the ghost of the Black Friar, which was supposed to have haunted the Abbey from the time of the dissolution of the monasteries, and which he thus describes from the recollection, perhaps, of his own fantasy, in <i>Don Juan</i>.⁠ ⁠… It is said that the Newstead ghost appeared, also, to Lord Byron’s cousin, Miss Fanny Parkins, and that she made a sketch of him from memory.” The legend of the Black Friar may, it is believed at Newstead (<i>et vide post</i>, <a class="pginternal" href="#songs2">“Song,” stanza <span epub:type="z3998:roman">ii</span></a> line 5, <abbr>p.</abbr> 583), be traced to the alarm and suspicion of the country-folk, who, on visiting the Abbey, would now and then catch sight of an aged lay-brother, or monkish domestic, who had been retained in the service of the Byrons long after the Canons had been “turned adrift.” He would naturally keep out of sight of a generation who knew not monks, and, when surprised in the cloisters or ruins of the church, would glide back to his own quarters in the dormitories.] <a href="canto-16.xhtml#noteref-1170" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>In French “<i>mobilité</i>.” I am not sure that mobility is English; but it is expressive of a quality which rather belongs to other climates, though it is sometimes seen to a great extent in our own. It may be defined as an excessive susceptibility of immediate impressions⁠—at the same time without <i>losing</i> the past: and is, though sometimes apparently useful to the possessor, a most painful and unhappy attribute.</p>
					<p>[“That he was fully aware not only of the abundance of this quality in his own nature, but of the danger in which it placed consistency and singleness of character, did not require the note on this passage to assure us. The consciousness, indeed, of his own natural tendency to yield thus to every chance impression, and change with every passing impulse, was not only for ever present in his mind, but⁠ ⁠… had the effect of keeping him in that general line of consistency, on certain great subjects, which⁠ ⁠… he continued to preserve throughout life.”⁠—<i>Life</i>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 646. “Mobility” is not the tendency to yield to <i>every</i> impression, to change with <i>every</i> impulse, but the capability of being moved by many and various impressions, of responding to an ever-renewed succession of impulses.

Before Byron left Italy he had begun (May 8, 1823) a seventeenth canto, and when he sailed for Greece he took the new stanzas with him. Trelawny found “fifteen stanzas of the seventeenth canto of <i>Don Juan</i>” in Byron’s room at Missolonghi (<i>Recollections, <abbr>etc.</abbr></i>, 1858, <abbr>p.</abbr> 237). The <abbr>MS.</abbr>, together with other papers, was handed over to John Cam Hobhouse, and is now in the possession of his daughter, the Lady Dorchester.
